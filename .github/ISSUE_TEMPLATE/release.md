## Minimum Jahia Version

> We aim at reducing the possible deployment matrices by regularly bumping up the minimum Jahia version when releasing new versions of our modules.
When creating a Release ticket for a module, consult with your PM to identify the new minimum Jahia version this module must be associated with.
The default guideline is for a new module release to be compatible with the 2 previous releases.

Current Jahia Version: 8.X.X.X (version currently in the POM)
Desired Jahia Version: 8.X.X.X

## Testing matrix

> We aim at clearly documenting the possible deployment scenarios in a matrix and specify which ones are expected to be tested or not.
In the testing matrix, always use the latest patch version of a particular release

|To Test (YES/NO)|Jahia Version|Dependency A|Dependency B|PASS / FAIL|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|YES / NO|8.1.1.2|1.0.0|3.0.0| |
|YES / NO|8.1.7.1|2.0.0|3.0.0| |
