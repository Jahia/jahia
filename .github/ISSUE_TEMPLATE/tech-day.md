name: Tech Day
about: Create a tech day ticket
title: ''
type: Tech Day

---

The goal of this ticket is to work on technical debt for a ticket within a fixed time window of 1 day.

## Organizing of your day

One day will NOT be sufficient to address technical debt for the codebase, organizing your day is key to wrap-up the tasks with concrete deliverable.

We recommend following this schedule:
- Begin by spending 1 hour to go over the checklist attached to this ticket, identify activities you would be able to complete within the day and create tickets for activities that would require more work or that you don't expect to complete. Make sure to link these new ticket to the techday ticket and to attach it to the checklist.
- Work on items identified during the first hour.
- Wrap up your day by spending 1 hour to document the changes you did, provide instructions for testing and eventually to give pointers to the next person working on a techday ticket for this codebase.

## Create tickets for future work
Not all tech debt items can be addressed within a day, the goal of this day is also to raise awareness about tech debt to be tackled in the future.

If you see a non-compliant element but you didn't get a chance to work on it, please create the corresponding ticket, attach it to the next fixVersion of the codebase and link it in this ticket.

Please fill the checklist available in this ticket, priorities are available as a guideline as to what we consider more or less important for each of the tech areas:

🚨 Indicates a required item, to be looked at during the day
🔝 Indicates a top priority item
🟠 Indicates a medium priority item
🙏 Indicates a low priority item

## Tech day checklist

This checklist is focused on a classic Jahia repository (module, app)

### Security
- [ ] 🔝 Our security lead confirmed there are no known security vulnerabilities affecting this codebase
### QA
- [ ] 🔝 Automated tests are using jahia-cypress for all utils functions
- [ ] 🔝 The test framework is using page-object models published by other modules
- [ ] 🔝 The test framework is publishing its own page-object models for use by others
- [ ] 🙏 Automated tests are using a recent version of Cypress
- [ ] 🙏 Automated tests are only relying on supported modules
### CI/CD
- [ ] 🔝 The build and the release workflows use the JDK 11 image (only if Jahia Parent is set to 8.2.0.0+)
- [ ] 🔝 GitHub Actions (nightlys and other workflows) are executed without warnings (such as depreciations)
- [ ] 🙏 The latest version of the actions are used (including jahia-modules-action)
### Documentation

### GitHub
- [ ] 🟠 [Branch protection](https://confluence.jahia.com/display/PR/GitHub+%28Product%29+-+Ref+ISPOL08.A14025#GitHub(Product)RefISPOL08.A14025-Branchprotection) is enabled for the repository
- [ ] **Automatically delete head branches** is selected in **Settings**
- [ ] 🙏 The repository contains a README.md file
- [ ] 🙏 Repository topics match are populated (at a minimum: "product" and "supported")
- [ ] 🙏 Stale branches or branches older than 2 years (non-maintenance branches) have been removed

## Fork day checklist

- [ ] 🚨 I created pull requests to push the fixes done in our fork to the main repository
- [ ] 🚨 I checked that we cannot upgrade to a more recent
- [ ] 🚨 I checked that we've documented why we're still using a fork of this library in [confluence](https://confluence.jahia.com/display/PR/Releasing+our+project+forks)
### Security
- [ ] 🔝 I checked that there are no known security vulnerabilities affecting this codebase
### CI/CD
- [ ] 🚨 The build and the release/publish workflows are configured (or at least documented in [confluence](https://confluence.jahia.com/display/PR/Releasing+our+project+forks))
### GitHub
- [ ] 🟠 [Branch protection](https://confluence.jahia.com/display/PR/GitHub+%28Product%29+-+Ref+ISPOL08.A14025#GitHub(Product)RefISPOL08.A14025-Branchprotection) is enabled for the repository
- [ ] **Automatically delete head branches** is selected in **Settings**
