type: Task
labels: ['Tech Day', 'Area:Tech']

---

The goal of this issue is to work on technical debt for a repository as part of the codebase ownership initiative. It is organized around team members regularly reviewing the state of codebases.

Creating a tech day ticket is not required to work on tech debt, but can be a helpful resource to identify areas of focus.

## Recommendations

You will not be able to address the entierety of a codebase tech debt in one go, organization is key to make sure you wrap-up time spent on a codebase with concrete deliverables.

When dedicating a fixed amount of time on a codebase, we recommend the following schedule:
- Begin by reviewing the checklist attached to this ticket, identify and prioritize activities you would be able to complete within the dedicated time.
- Work on said items.
- Wrap up by briefly documenting the changes you did, provide instructions for testing and eventually create issues for activities you'd like to work on next. You can do so by adding a comment to this issue.

## Create tickets for future work
Not all tech debt items can be addressed in one day, one of the goal of the ownership initiative is also to raise awareness about tech debt to be tackled in the future.

When creating such tickets, try to provide details about complexity of such an implementation. These elements play a role in our capacity to prioritize work.

## About priorities

* 🚨 Indicates a required item, to be looked at
* 🔝 Indicates a top priority item
* 🟠 Indicates a medium priority item
* 🙏 Indicates a low priority item
