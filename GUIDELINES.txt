Developer Guidelines
====================

Introduction
------------
The goal of this document is to present the guidelines for developers working on the Jahia source code. It is strongly
recommended that all developers familiarize themselves with these rules and then apply them and possibly also extend or
review them.

Code style conventions
----------------------
- We are based on the Sun coding style conventions : http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/ , with a few modifications
- We allow lines longer than 80 characters
- We do not allow the usage of tabs as spacers
- We do NOT put braces on separate lines, this helps make the code a little more compact. We also put opening and
closing braces even for single-line statements.

Properties files
----------------
- Properties files must ALWAYS be encoded in ISO-8859-1. If they concern resource bundles, they should use the \u
encoding for non ISO-8859-1 characters as it is the standard. We recommend you edit resources bundles with specialized
editors such as JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA or other resource bundle translation utilities.

XML files
---------
- XML files should always validate.
- Use indentation and keep the files easy to read
- Insert comments to help understand the file

Singletons
----------
- Don't create singletons, we have Spring that does a much better job at creating objects and making them available. If
don't know how to use Spring, just ask someone who knows :)
- When you see a singleton and have the time to do some maintenance, try to remove it.

Configuration files
-------------------
- Don't hardcode settings in Spring configuration files, refer them from properties files
- Design in services as "modules", with their separate configuration file if they are adding a new service, or inside
in an existing one if already has a "classification" (such as users-groups for example).
- Always document each setting you add. It's ok if you don't do it immediately, but do it before you commit
- Choose a setting name that makes sense, think about the user of the setting, that needs to understand it
- It might be a good idea to prefix your setting with your class package, so that you don't conflict with other settings
- Regroup similar settings into groups, to make it easy for users looking for settings to be able to find them
- Integrate with the Maven plugin jahia:configure goal if needed
- Think hard about the default values of your settings, especially in terms of performance and memory usage.
- Try to make your properties "portable", so that we may move them to another storage system, such as a database
easily.
- Avoid putting configuration files in WEB-INF/classes. And always make them overrideable using the classpath mechanism
(meaning that default configuration files can be overridden with a configuration provided in the classpath). This helps
make node-specific configuration on cluster-installed servers.
- Avoid putting configuration in the web.xml file, prefer Spring configuration that is more easy to re-use and also
use in test units. In this case the best is using Spring to expose the bean to a property coming from the Jahia
properties file.

Transactions
------------
- Although transactions are not (yet) active in Jahia, make sure all the new code you write is transaction-friendly.
This means that you should avoid locks, and make copies instead of holding on to shared resources, such as cache entries
for example. Some cache implementations will even do this for you.
- Don’t use shared caches (or maps) directly, as they are not ACID-compliant
- Introduce session caches (if needed), or re-use a framework that implements sessions caches
- Think about rollback, how does it work ? Better : write a test unit that fails an operation
- How do you guarantee ACID properties? Make sure your code is ACID-compliant
- If the power goes off, is your data corrupted or not ? Design to allow for the worst possible failure !
- If you have long background tasks, don’t put them in a single “transaction”, split them
- Avoid creating thread yourself, use Spring’s support for scheduling instead.
- Avoid calling JCR session.save() too often, ideally we should do it only once in a transaction.
- Don’t use synchronized methods, as they cause problems with multi-threading transactions

Websphere
---------
- Be careful when you write JSP files, especially including tags that embed double-quotes within double-quotes. In
general WAS (WebSphere Application Server) prefers that you surround double-quotes with single-quotes, and NOT the
opposite
- Avoid tag files if you can, on some version of WAS, they are very buggy
- Be careful that hashmaps will not be processed in the same order than on the Sun JVM. So any startup that works
"magically" because of the default ordering on the Sun JVM might not work on WAS. For example Spring dependencies must
be explicitely configured with depends-on or real dependency injection when possible.
- You can find more details at : http://jira.jahia.org/browse/DOCU-60
- Don't create your own threads. Websphere will not like this at all. If you have no other choice, use Quartz to perform
background tasks.
- Don't access or bind JNDI resources outside of a container managed thread. Websphere doesn't allow it.
- If you bind something in JNDI, you must unbind for proper undeployment.

Weblogic
--------
TBC

JBoss
-----
TBC

Tomcat
------
- Always test your developments by performing a clean shutdown of Tomcat, not by simply killing the JVM. This will help
fix quickly resource freeing bugs. Use the destroy() method on the main servlets or simply integrate with Spring which
will do this for you.

Developing services
-------------------
- New services should always be developed with injection and should NEVER use singletons. If you're not using Spring or
Google Guice or some other type of injection, you're probably doing it wrong. Your service should also be started and
stopped using Spring lifecycle methods.
- AVOID IMPLEMENTING SINGLETONS ! If you re-use existing singleton and have no way of doing otherwise except
rewriting a lot of code that's acceptable, but should be avoided at all costs.
- When performing JCR operations with a system sessions, make sure you always use the JCRTemplate mechanism, as is
illustrated in the example below :
            return jcrTemplate.doExecuteWithSystemSession(new JCRCallback<JahiaUser>() {
                public JahiaUser doInJCR(JCRSessionWrapper session) throws RepositoryException {
                    Node usersFolderNode = session.getNode("/" + Constants.CONTENT + "/users/" + name.trim());
                    if (usersFolderNode.getProperty(JCRUser.J_EXTERNAL).getBoolean()) {
                        JCRUser user = new JCRUser(usersFolderNode.getIdentifier(), jcrTemplate.getSessionFactory());
                        cache.put(name, user);
                        return user;
                    }
                    return null;
                }
            });
This will make sure that all the exceptions handling, session handling etc is properly done for you, and you can
concentrate on implementing the actual JCR operations. This will also in the future offer services such as transaction
participating, etc. Make sure also you use the proper callback and not just the one illustrated above.
- For normal JCR session, the JCRSessionFilter will close the session for you at the end of the request processing. If
you are performing operations OUTSIDE of a request, make sure you close the session at the end of the handling (TODO:
might be a good idea to offer a more generic Spring-based framework for "transaction" handling).
- When developing a GWT back-end service, make sure you declare it as the others are declared in the
applicationcontext-gwt.xml services. Again, make sure you use dependency injection *everywhere*. For URL mapping, you
should either add it to the SimpleUrlHandlerMapping or dynamically register with the HandlerMapping (this will be great
when we go the OSGi route).
- When referencing files, make sure you always use Spring' Resource class instead of a String or a File reference. This
makes it easier to modify the location of the file at deployment time.
- Take the time to modify legacy services to make them more modern. Little by little, this will help migrate to the new
way of doing things. If you need more time, make sure the product owner is informed that we will have to do this later.
- Design your service so that it can automatically register itself into the system, and not that it must be declared in
a list of service. Imagine that your service might be deployed dynamically in an already running system (even if it
isn't the case right now), and that it should be able to do so.
- Get familiar with OSGi
- Make sure you leverage Spring as much as possible

Exception handling
------------------
- NEVER do this :
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error(e);
        }
This will not log the stack trace of the exception, only the error message.
- Except in cases you really master and expect, always remount the exception because it might impact the global
operation and it might need to be handled at a higher level (i.e. transactions).
- When throwing an exception from an existing exception, always include the source exception in the new exception being
thrown.

Javadoc
-------
- Document the class, describe it's responsibility, what it does, and how it fits into the global system
- Sometimes it's more important to document the method's parameters and return values than what it does if the name
of the method is very explicit
- Make sure you mark deprecated methods
- For tags, also supply the TLD doc
- If javadocs are missing to a class you are modifying, try to add as much as possible, correcting any errors too.
- Use TODOs to mark stuff that still needs to be done at a later time.
