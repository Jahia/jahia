/**
 * <p>Title: EntryPointDefinition for a web application</p>
 * <p>Description: A web application may contain multiple entry point
 * definitions, depending on the type of web application we are dealing with.
 * Servlet-based web application will for example have multiple servlet
 * mappings that will all be possible entry points into the application.
 * Portlet-based web applications will have multiple portlets in an application.
 * Note that the data contain in this object is generated by the
 * ApplicationManagerProvider, and it not meant to be stored in Jahia's
 * database, but provided by the implementation of each provider (in the case
 * of servlet-based web apps we parse the web.xml and for portlets we use
 * Jetspeed 2's registry sub-system).</p>
