//
// Development notes : for the moment this class does not handle the problematic
// of reading an input stream multiple times. This can cause problems if for
// example Jahia needs to read the InputStream object from the request before
// forwarding it to a web application. Also, under some server implementations,
// such as the Orion server, retrieving an InputStream object before reading the
// parameters will cause an error when trying to call a getParameter method.
// The main issue of all this is that we are very dependant on the implementation
// of these methods right now. A solution that was studied involved writing
// parsers for the content of the request and managing the body internally inside
// Jahia. This is probably the most solid way to do it, but it involves a lot of
// development, especially since there should be a significant performance hit
// if not done fully.
// Basically the solution would be something like this :
// 1. Jahia retrieves the InputStream (or Reader) object
// 2. Jahia retrieves the full content and stores it either in memory or on disk
// depending on some criteria to be defined (size, type of request ?)
// 3. Jahia parses the parameters included in the request body, making sure it
// then uses only the result of that parsing internally
// 4. Jahia's dispatching service can then emulate a full web container behaviour
// without much problems, since it can intercept everything, include the request
// body (which is the part of the emulation currently missing). So the application
// could indeed retrieve an InputStream or a Reader that is passed the body only
// of that application and that comes from memory or disk storage instead of the
// socket.
//
// Advantages :
// - Allows for a FULL implementation of a request object
// - Allows Jahia and web applications to process the request multiple times
// - Improved security because we could only pass the body that concerns the
// web application.
//
// Disadvantages :
// - Serious performance hit because the worst case is : Jahia processes the
// request body, parses it, forwards it to the app, that reprocesses it again !
// The current case is : Jahia forwards it directly to the webapp, not reading
// it most of the time.
// - Loss of security because in some cases an application can receive a GET
// request that actually has the body of a POST request (this is because the
// emulation replaces the URL but not the body currently, mostly for performance
// reasons).
// - More usage of resources, since request bodies should have to be stored
// in memory and/or on disk, probably multiple times.
// The current decision was not to go forward with this implementation since it
// will involve a lot of work and that the benefits are dependant on the applications
// that must run under it. If the applications do not undergo problems in the
// meantime the current solution should be sufficient.
