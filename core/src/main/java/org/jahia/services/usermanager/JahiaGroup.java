/**
 * This class represents a group of <code>Principals</code> which can be users

 * </br>
 * Each group is defined with a name, which is unique inside a site, but not
 * necessarily unique between two sites. Each group has also a unique
 * identification key, which is unique in the database. This way, a group is
 * uniquely identified in all the sites and Jahia servers sharing the same
 * database.</br>
 * </br>
 * The group names are used only to present an intuitive signification for the
 * administrators of each site. As the key is the only way to assure unicity
 * between the sites and servers, it will be used to represent the group inside
 * of jahia and not the group name.
