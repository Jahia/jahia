    ==========================================================================================

        Rooted in Open Source CMS, Jahia's Digital Industrialization paradigm is about
        streamlining Enterprise digital projects across channels to truly control
        time-to-market and TCO, project after project.
        Putting an end to "the Tunnel effect", the Jahia Studio enables IT and
        marketing teams to collaboratively and iteratively build cutting-edge
        online business solutions.
        These, in turn, are securely and easily deployed as modules and apps,
        reusable across any digital projects, thanks to the Jahia Private App Store Software.
        Each solution provided by Jahia stems from this overarching vision:
        Digital Factory, Workspace Factory, Portal Factory and eCommerce Factory.
        Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland,
        Jahia Solutions Group has its North American headquarters in Washington DC,
        with offices in Chicago, Toronto and throughout Europe.
        Jahia counts hundreds of global brands and governmental organizations
        among its loyal customers, in more than 20 countries across the globe.
