Jahia 6.5

This module defines currently two components
- TwitterSearch: displays, within a page, a simple search box that dynamically outputs the resulting twitter feed.
The search object is not stored in the JCR, this is just a parameter passed on the fly to get a result.

- TwitterFeed: Defines a search/query tag, which is stored in the JCR. The component thus permanently
displays the resulting live Twitter Feed.
