 *     Each solution provided by Jahia stems from this overarching vision:
 *     Digital Factory, Workspace Factory, Portal Factory and eCommerce Factory.

 *     Jahia Solutions Group has its North American headquarters in Washington DC,
 *     with offices in Chicago, Toronto and throughout Europe.
